# Five-a-side: Premier League Quiz Game

A football-themed quiz game where you try to guess as many Premier League players as possible using your chosen letters.

## Basic Rules

1. Choose your starting lineup: 1 vowel and 4 consonants
2. Use these letters to help you identify players
3. You can guess either the player's full name or just their surname to get the point
4. Each round lasts 45 seconds (except Round 3 which is 30 seconds)
5. You get 3 point per correct guess in Rounds 1 and 2, and 6 points per correct guess in Round 3

## Game Features

### Substitutions

- You get 5 substitutions per game
- Vowels can only be substituted for vowels, and consonants for consonants
- Use these wisely to help identify more players

### Passes

- You get 5 passes per game
- Use these to skip players you're unsure about

### VAR Hints

- Round 1: Start with 5 VAR hints
- Round 2: Get 5 more VAR hints
- Round 3: Get 3 more VAR hints
- Unused hints roll over to the next round
- Each check gives you a hint about the player's identity

## Special Rules

### Shot on Target Rule

If your guess is close to the correct surname, it counts as a goal! For example:

- "Lampty" for "Lamptey"
- "Robertsno" for "Robertson"
- "Pedor" for "Pedro"

This rule recognizes that you clearly knew the player but had a small typo.

### Time Wasting Rule

To prevent cheating by repeatedly opening the guess window, there's a strict three-strikes policy:

1. First Time Wasting Offense

   - If you open the guess window 3+ times for the same player
   - You get a warning message (in green)
   - Costs you one guess
   - Message: "That's a warning for time wasting! Get on with the game!"

2. Second Time Wasting Offense

   - If you do it again on any player
   - You get a yellow card message
   - Costs you another guess
   - Message: "That's a booking for time wasting! Get on with the game!"

3. Third Time Wasting Offense
   - If you do it a third time
   - You get a red card message
   - Game Over
   - Message: "I can't believe you have got yourself sent off for time wasting!"

### Game Over Conditions

The game ends when either:

- You complete all three rounds
- You get 3 wrong guesses
- You get three time wasting penalties
- You leave they game (go to another window)

## Rounds

1. **Round 1** (45 seconds)

   - Guess current Premier League players
   - 3 points per correct guess
   - Start with 5 VAR hints

2. **Round 2** (45 seconds)

   - Guess Premier League legends
   - 3 points per correct guess
   - Get 5 more VAR hints (plus any unused hints from Round 1)

3. **Round 3** (30 seconds)

   - Get 3 more VAR hints (plus any unused hints from Round 2)

## Tips

- Use your substitutions strategically - save them for when you really need them
- Don't waste time on players you're unsure about - use your passes
- Consider saving some VAR hints for Rounds 2 and 3 where the players might be harder to identify
- The final round only gets 3 new VAR hints, so managing your hints throughout the game is crucial
- Be careful not to time waste - you'll get penalized!
- Remember you only need the surname to get the point
