# five-a-side: Premier League Quiz Game

A football-themed quiz game that tests your knowledge of Premier League players past and present. Choose your letters wisely, manage your team strategically, and try to score as many points as possible!

## Game Overview

In five-a-side, you'll be challenged to identify Premier League players across three different rounds. You start by choosing five letters (your team) that will help reveal matching letters in player names. As in real football, you'll need to use your resources wisely to maximize your score.

## Game Setup

### Choosing Your Team

1. Select exactly 5 letters:
   - 1 vowel (A, E, I, O, U)
   - 4 consonants
   - These letters will reveal matching letters in player names
   - Choose carefully - these are your starting players!

## Game Structure

### Three Rounds

1. **Round 1: Current Premier League Players**

   - Duration: 45 seconds
   - Points: 1 point per correct guess
   - Features current Premier League stars

2. **Round 2: Premier League Legends**

   - Duration: 45 seconds
   - Points: 1 point per correct guess
   - Features iconic players from Premier League history

3. **Round 3: Forgotten Premier League Stars**
   - Duration: 30 seconds
   - Points: 3 points per correct guess
   - Features cult heroes and memorable characters from Premier League past

## Game Mechanics

### Making Guesses

- Type in the player name and submit your guess
- Only the surname needs to be spelled correctly to get points
- Slight misspellings are accepted (e.g., "Kulisevki" for "Kulusevski")
- You get 3 wrong guesses total before the game ends
- Warning system:
  1. First wrong guess: Warning
  2. Second wrong guess: Yellow card
  3. Third wrong guess: Red card - Game Over!

### Match Management Options

#### Substitutions (5 available)

- Swap out your current letters for new ones
- Vowels can only be substituted for vowels
- Consonants can only be substituted for consonants
- Used letters cannot be selected again
- Once a letter is substituted off, it cannot reveal letters in new player names
- However, any letters already revealed in the current player's name remain visible

#### Passes (5 available)

- Skip the current player
- Move on to the next player without using a guess
- Use strategically when unsure or to save your guesses

#### VAR Checks (5 available)

- Get a hint about the player's identity
- Provides a clue about the player's career or achievements
- Use when you need extra information to make your guess

## Game End Conditions

The game can end in several ways:

1. Completing all three rounds successfully
2. Receiving three wrong guesses (red card)
3. Switching tabs or minimizing the window (Anti-cheating measure)

### Anti-Cheating System

- Switching tabs or minimizing the window will immediately end your game
- This prevents looking up answers during gameplay
- Keep the game tab active and visible at all times!

## Scoring System

- Rounds 1 & 2: 1 point per correct guess
- Round 3: 3 points per correct guess
- Try to maximize your score by:
  - Using substitutions strategically
  - Saving passes for difficult players
  - Using VAR checks wisely
  - Managing your guesses carefully

## Tips for Success

1. Choose your initial letters strategically - common letters will reveal more
2. Save some substitutions for the later rounds
3. Don't waste guesses - use passes if unsure
4. VAR checks are valuable - use them on difficult players
5. Consider saving resources for Round 3 where points are tripled
6. Keep an eye on the timer - each round goes quickly!

Remember, just like in real football, resource management and tactical decisions are key to success. Good luck!
